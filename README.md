 Artemis finacial was looking for someone who could assist them with their software security, They wanted me to assist them in their needs to mitigate their vulnerabilities and security defenses. 

 When we ran the tests we where able to advance their security and fortify their systems with strong secure coding that was more reliable and protected the clients sensitive information and processes.

 The assmenst where tough and extremely challenging. In this case I found that the hardest thing to do was to figure out the certs and the security authorizations. There where no issues with oding adn coming up with a mitigation plan, I was able to get through the vulnerability testing fine but I found myself having multiple issues with the coding right from the get. I believe that falls on the schhool. The codes where so bad and the issues persisted that I found myself trouble shooting more than leanring and the class ended up being a wash because I did have the time to put into learning after the hours of fixing issue. This is a reflection of module 5 and project one being uploaded as examples of what I was able to do and project 2 never ran correctly.

 Increasing layers I used multi authentication factoring but moving forward, I intend to leverage vulnerability scanning tools and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and determine the most effective mitigation strategies.

 We did rigerous testing and code review to make sure the code was good and running vulnerability testing as well

Throughout the projects and assignments, I discovered the effectiveness of utilizing vulnerability scanning tools, conducting penetration testing, and implementing secure coding practices. I believe these resources will prove invaluable for future assignments or tasks.

Unfortunetly with the structure of the course I was never able to finish rproject 2 to my full potential and in this case I feel I would have let myself down. I plan on going back and possibly completing this final project for myself and future employees with an update on the status here. For now I found that the course was a bit rough and could have been more stright forward, This is a reflection of not having hands on with professor and teh down side to online learning.
